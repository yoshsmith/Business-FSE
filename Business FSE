    <h2>Article 1: Title: Schow On Orchestra Wage Dispute: ‘This Is Not A Case Of Unequal Pay For Equal Work’, December 18th 2018, The Daily Wire </h2>
    <p>Summary: This article speaks about a complaint made by a female in the Boston symphony about how she was being discriminated against because a male who was playing the oboe was being paid more than her. She played the Flute. This woman believes playing the flute is like playing the Oboe, as far as pay is concerned. This statement is absolutely ridiculous. The Senior editor Ashe Schow then goes on to say “I don’t believe she has an argument. This is not a case of unequal pay for equal work. These are two very different instruments, the oboe — trying to find a principal oboist is a much more difficult process than finding a flutist.” Then as the Daily Wire usually does, he brings in facts and evidence to back up his stance on the issue and to prove that this women is completely wrong. </p1>
    <p>Course Concept: This article can be related to the discrimination section of the course. Discrimination is very real in the workforce for all races and sexes but straight white men are the most discriminated against. Many people would not agree with this statement, but it is true. We see discrimination cases on the news but all they show is how women or blacks are discriminated against. This is because they are leftist news sources that do not care about the truth, they care about making us look bad. The only way to find the truth is to listen to people like Ben Shapiro with the Daily Wire, Owen Shroyer, Charlie Kirk and there are a few others who actually go searching for the truth. Companies nowadays are starting to discriminate against straight white men because they want to look good. Not only that, they also discriminate against Republicans. People who are Republican are being refused jobs. The claim this women is making in this article is as dumb as the claim women are making that women in sports should be paid as much as men. We see women everywhere complaining about getting discriminated against in the workforce when it is completely not true. This article and problem is based in the United States where there was an Equal pay act put into place in 1963 I believe, so if the Boston symphony was really paying her unequally then it would be completely illegal and they risk getting shut down. I seriously doubt they would do that to pay a man a bit more than a female.</p2>

    <h2> Article 2: ‘Infuriated’ Trump Considers New Unilateral Steps To Boost Economy, Pushing Back Tax Deadline Even Further, May 8th 2020, the Daily Wire </h2>
    <p>Summary: This article written by James Barrett is  about President Trump pushing back tax deadlines to help Americans during the Pandemic. The article begins with him explaining Amid the ongoing economic devastation of widespread shutdowns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House is considering taking unilateral steps to try to shore up the crippled economy, including extending the federal tax filing deadline even further — to as late as Dec. 15. He talks about how the deadline depends on how and when businesses open back up. He talks about how Trump is getting infuriated with the amount the unemployment rate is rising as before the pandemic Trump had gotten the unemployment rate to one of the lowest its ever been, for all races and both genders.</p1>
    <p>Course Content: This article can be related to the COVID-19 case study we wrote an essay on. Many businesses are having to shut down or lay off employees which is causing millions to go unemployed and is crippling America. But for someone like President Trump, America is like his business and he's trying to keep people employees. But he’s got one huge problem on his shoulders and that the democrats. The democrats keep blocking Trump from funding small businesses and getting money to the people and the democrats are using the covid funding to fund their own parties' ideas. It’s absolutely pathetic. I understand how Trump is infuriated, while hes working non-stop to get these Americans help, the democrats are spending time and money to make lies about him and to fund their ideas such as the green new deal. Big companies as well as small companies are shutting down forcing people to go broke. Like business owners are doing things for covid-19, Trump has put travel bans into place, sent money to bail out small businesses.</p2>
    <h2> Article 3: Joe Biden’s Virtual Rally In Tampa Goes Hilariously Wrong, May 9th 2020, Ashe Schow </h2>
    <p>Summary: The Democrats claim to be the party of technology ever since Obamas campaign in 2008. This article starts by talking about how Joe Biden tried to hold a virtual rally but of course knowing Joe Biden it went terribly wrong to the point where the campaign had to edit the video to put on YouTube. The author Ash Schow said, “Biden’s campaign attempted to recreate a real live rally over a live stream, with a musical act, a reading of the pledge of allegiance, and multiple local politicians praising the former vice president before he actually spoke. None of it went as planned.” Everything just went horrible as the Democrats tried too hard to make it a rally and messed everything up. When it was Bidens turn to speak he had no idea he was live and the feed started glitching. While Biden was speaking there was a bird in the background tweeting and interupting him.</p1>
    <p>Course content: This article can be related to the technology part of our course. The leftist media has been real good with technology when they are able to edit videos of conservatives speaking so that the conservatives look bad, but they never seem to be able to get it right when they are live. The Democrats claiming, they are the party of technology is just another claim they make that is false. Like the claim that they are the tolerant left yet Trump supporters and republicans are being run over, beat, killed and other horrible things. Just like they claim they are the anti-racism party, yet they were the ones who backed slavery and founded the KKK and are the ones who are getting their campaigns funded by the KKK. Technologie has become a big part in our culture today and not being able to properly use to do something like hold a virtual rally is pretty embarrassing. But as I said before they are very good at deleting clips and editing them.</p2>

He used his Money to start up Caxton Mark which is now a large business that deals with almost every country in the world.

<h2>Cartoon 1</h2>
<img src="https://www.cartoonistgroup.com/properties/kelley/art_images/cg5c73ae92b87b0.jpg" />

<p>This cartoon can be related to the discrimination part of our course, except it's not in the workforce. The media only shows discrimination towards black people, Asians, women etc. But never towards white men. For example currently the big thing is the murder of Ahmaud Arbury by two white men, but what about the white men who are killed by black people or as this cartoon shows, how about the Trump supporters who are beat and killed on the daily. This is discrimination we need to fix. All these people are doing is supporting their president and they are literally being murdered for it. When will the day come when a Trump supporter doesn't have to fear for his life every time he leaves his house wearing an article of clothing or a sign supporting their president?</p>

<p> This article can relate to the discriminations/bias podcast we listened to. I chose this cartoon as its kind of funny to me. Women nowadays think they are paid unequally to men and i find that hilarious. Men are not paid more for the same job, men are paid more because they are working hard and getting the promotions and making their way up in companies. But if you look at the actual facts the top earners are not men, they are Asian women but feminist don't want to look at those facts. Not to mention the equal pay Act in 1963 that would make it completely illegal for companies to pay men more than women for the same job.</p>    <p> This article can relate to the discriminations/bias podcast we listened to.

<div id="Movie Reffrence">
<h1> Movie Reffrence</h1>
<h2>Lone Survivor</h2>
<p>Summary: The movie I chose was lone survivor. The movie lone survivor is about 4 men in the NAVY SEALs that were tasked with a task to do some recon on a village that the military believed was where a wanted taliban leader who had murdered many Americans was located. They climbed up mountains and did some recon from there but they unexpectedly ran into some goat herders and they decided to let the goat herders go which meant they had to abandon mission as the goat herders would obviously run down to tell the Taliban. After a Few Hours the 4 men come into contact with 100's of Taliban fighters and an all out firefight followed, it ended with 3 of the four men dead and the last man was saved by some afghans who supported the Americans.</p>
