    <h2>Article 1: Title: Schow On Orchestra Wage Dispute: ‘This Is Not A Case Of Unequal Pay For Equal Work’, December 18th 2018, The Daily Wire </h2>
    <p1>Summary: This article speaks about a complaint made by a female in the Boston symphony about how she was being discriminated against because a male who was playing the oboe was being paid more than her. She played the Flute. This woman believes playing the flute is like playing the Oboe, as far as pay is concerned. This statement is absolutely ridiculous. The Senior editor Ashe Schow then goes on to say “I don’t believe she has an argument. This is not a case of unequal pay for equal work. These are two very different instruments, the oboe — trying to find a principal oboist is a much more difficult process than finding a flutist.” Then as the Daily Wire usually does, he brings in facts and evidence to back up his stance on the issue and to prove that this women is completely wrong. </p1>
    <p2>Course Concept: This article can be related to the discrimination section of the course. Discrimination is very real in the workforce for all races and sexes but straight white men are the most discriminated against. Many people would not agree with this statement, but it is true. We see discrimination cases on the news but all they show is how women or blacks are discriminated against. This is because they are leftist news sources that do not care about the truth, they care about making us look bad. The only way to find the truth is to listen to people like Ben Shapiro with the Daily Wire, Owen Shroyer, Charlie Kirk and there are a few others who actually go searching for the truth. Companies nowadays are starting to discriminate against straight white men because they want to look good. Not only that, they also discriminate against Republicans. People who are Republican are being refused jobs. The claim this women is making in this article is as dumb as the claim women are making that women in sports should be paid as much as men. We see women everywhere complaining about getting discriminated against in the workforce when it is completely not true. This article and problem is based in the United States where there was an Equal pay act put into place in 1963 I believe, so if the Boston symphony was really paying her unequally then it would be completely illegal and they risk getting shut down. I seriously doubt they would do that to pay a man a bit more than a female.</p2>

    <h2> Article 2: ‘Infuriated’ Trump Considers New Unilateral Steps To Boost Economy, Pushing Back Tax Deadline Even Further, May 8th 2020, the Daily Wire </h2>
    <p1>Summary: This article written by James Barrett is  about President Trump pushing back tax deadlines to help Americans during the Pandemic. The article begins with him explaining Amid the ongoing economic devastation of widespread shutdowns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House is considering taking unilateral steps to try to shore up the crippled economy, including extending the federal tax filing deadline even further — to as late as Dec. 15. He talks about how the deadline depends on how and when businesses open back up. He talks about how Trump is getting infuriated with the amount the unemployment rate is rising as before the pandemic Trump had gotten the unemployment rate to one of the lowest its ever been, for all races and both genders.</p1>
    <p2>Course Content: This article can be related to the COVID-19 case study we wrote an essay on. Many businesses are having to shut down or lay off employees which is causing millions to go unemployed and is crippling America. But for someone like President Trump, America is like his business and he's trying to keep people employees. But he’s got one huge problem on his shoulders and that the democrats. The democrats keep blocking Trump from funding small businesses and getting money to the people and the democrats are using the covid funding to fund their own parties' ideas. It’s absolutely pathetic. I understand how Trump is infuriated, while hes working non-stop to get these Americans help, the democrats are spending time and money to make lies about him and to fund their ideas such as the green new deal. Big companies as well as small companies are shutting down forcing people to go broke. Like business owners are doing things for covid-19, Trump has put travel bans into place, sent money to bail out small businesses.</p2>
